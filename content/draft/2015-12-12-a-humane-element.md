At work, I’ve been working on a single user story (ie. a work task) for two months now. In many ways, it hasn’t felt right. First of all it’s not a user story, as it’s not user related, but a technical enabler instead. It is also way too complex; nothing should take two months in software development.

That has caused me some significant stress lately.

Today I heard we’ll be getting new business cards at work. There was an internal chat about those, and for an hour it seemed that out of the blue, everyone really cared about their business cards once again (yep, I sent my comments as well) — though I have trouble remembering when was the last time I needed one. People commented about typeface, colors, messages, business titles, just about everything.

That didn’t feel right either.
